      <h2>Types of Funeral Services</h2>

      <h3>Traditional Funeral Services</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional funeral services in Houston typically include a viewing or visitation period, followed by a funeral ceremony and graveside service. These services can be customized to honor your loved one's life and reflect their personal or religious beliefs.
      </p>

      <h3>Memorial Services</h3>
      <p>
        Memorial services offer more flexibility in timing and location, as they can be held without the deceased present. These services focus on celebrating the life lived and can be personalized with photos, music, and meaningful tributes.
      </p>

      <h3>Graveside Services</h3>
      <p>
        For those preferring a simpler approach, graveside services provide an intimate setting for family and friends to gather and say their final goodbyes directly at the burial site.
